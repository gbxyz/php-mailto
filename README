Historical Note
===============

It's been ten years since I first published mailto.php, and in that time 
the techniques used by spammers to harvest email addresses have moved 
on. Modern web spiders now include Javascript engines, making the 
obfuscation techniques that mailto.php uses obsolete.

However, since this library has been very widely deployed, and embedded 
in other applications that continue to be maintained and developed, I 
will continue to maintain the public repository for mailto.php, for 
historical reasons if nothing else.

1. Introduction

The purpose of mailto.php is to reclaim the mailto: link from e-mail address
harvesters. It uses JavaScript to obfuscate a mailto: hyperlink, so that a web
page author can provide a link to an e-mail address without worrying that it
might be picked up by spammers.


2. Installation

Installation is easy: simply place the mailto.php file somewhere on your
web server's filesystem and include() or require() it somewhere on each
page you want to use it.


3. Usage

Please see the test.php file for usage instructions.


5. Compatability

Ensuring the compatability of JavaScript is always a problem, but mailto.php
has been tested in the following web browsers:

	Mozilla
	Internet Explorer
	Netscape Communicator
	Opera
	Konqueror
	Safari

mailto.php will also include an appropriate string in <noscript> tags for
non-JavaScript browsers.


6. License
