1. Introduction

The purpose of mailto.php is to reclaim the mailto: link from e-mail address
harvesters. It uses JavaScript to obfuscate a mailto: hyperlink, so that a web
page author can provide a link to an e-mail address without worrying that it
might be picked up by spammers.


2. Installation

Installation is easy: simply place the mailto.php file somewhere on your
web server's filesystem and include() or require() it somewhere on each
page you want to use it.


3. Usage

There are two ways to use mailto.php. The first method is if your website is
built using PHP and you want to use an obfuscated e-mail address in an
otherwise static page:

<p>	If you have any problems, please e-mail the
	<? mailto('webmaster@site.com', 'webmaster'); ?>
	and let them know.
</p>

The second way is useful for developing an application that uses templates or
writes static files. Rather than directly printing the output it returns the
obfuscated link in a string:

<?php
	$link = smailto('webmaster@site.com', 'webmaster');

	// you can now use $link as many times as you like:
	print $link;
	fputs($fh, $link);
?>

These two functions have the same relationship as printf() and sprintf(),
hence the naming style used.

The functions can accept either one or two arguments. If you specify just one
argument, the e-mail address, then the link created will contain the e-mail
address itself as the link text. If you specify a second argument, then its
contents will be used as the link text.


4. Credits

I had been mulling over this for some time before I came across Paul Gregg's
implementation that gave me the incentive to complete it. His system is nice
but isn't easily implemented across a whole site since you have to copy and
paste from his web page. This should be a bit more user-friendly. Paul's
website is at http://www.pgregg.com/.


5. Compatability

Ensuring the compatability of JavaScript is always a problem, but mailto.php
has been tested in the following web browsers:

	Mozilla (main development environment):
		Galeon
		Netscape 6
		K-Meleon
	Netscape 4.x
	Opera 5+
	Konqueror 2.x

mailto.php will also include an appropriate string in <noscript> tags for
non-JavaScript browsers.
