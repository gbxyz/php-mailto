1. Introduction

The purpose of mailto.php is to reclaim the mailto: link from e-mail address
harvesters. It uses JavaScript to obfuscate a mailto: hyperlink, so that a web
page author can provide a link to an e-mail address without worrying that it
might be picked up by spammers.


2. Installation

Installation is easy: simply place the mailto.php file somewhere on your
web server's filesystem and include() or require() it somewhere on each
page you want to use it.


3. Usage

.
.
.
<p>	If you have any problems, please e-mail the
	<? mailto('webmaster@site.com', 'webmaster'); ?>
	and let them know.
</p>

The library contains the function mailto() which accepts two arguments. The
first is the e-mail address to be linked to, the second is the link text,
which may be blank.


4. Credits

I had been mulling over this for some time before I came across Paul Gregg's
implementation that gave me the incentive to complete it. His system is nice
but isn't easily implemented across a whole site since you have to copy and
paste from his web page. This should be a bit more user-friendly.


5. Compatability

Ensuring the compatability of JavaScript is always a problem, but mailto.php
has been tested in the following web browsers:

	Mozilla (main development environment):
		Galeon
		Netscape 6
		Konqueror
	Netscape 4.x
	Opera 5+
	Konqueror 2.x

mailto.php will also include an appropriate string in <noscript> tags for
non-JavaScript browsers.
